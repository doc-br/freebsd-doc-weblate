"The easiest way to handle leap seconds is with the POSIX time rules FreeBSD "
"uses by default, combined with link:{handbook}#network-ntp[NTP].  When man:"
"ntpd[8] is running and the time is synchronized with upstream NTP servers "
"that handle leap seconds correctly, the leap second will cause the system "
"time to automatically repeat the last second of the day.  No other "
"adjustments are necessary."
