== Abstract

[.abstract-title]
The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}. Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/].

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution. It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/] or any of its mirrors. More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}/mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD appendix] to the link:{handbook}/[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since {releasePrev}. In general, changes described here are unique to the {releaseBranch} branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in [.filename]#/usr/src/UPDATING#.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updating UEFI ESP partitions (the partition the firmware boots from) has changed.
See <<boot>> for important details.

[[userland]]
== Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications, contributed software, and system utilities.

[[userland-config]]
=== Userland Configuration Changes


[[userland-programs]]
=== Userland Application Changes

The {{< manpage "calendar" "1" >}} utility got back support for nested C pre-processor conditionals and gains support for the C++ comment syntax in addition to the C syntax. gitref:19b5c307548[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "calendar" "1" >}} utility has been modified to consistently print dates according to the locale of the invoking user, not the possibly varying locales of included files. gitref:f1560bd080a[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "calendar" "1" >}} utility has been fixed to use the correct paths for included files if invoked with the -a option. gitref:19b5c307548[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "calendar" "1" >}} utility does no longer install data files other than calendar.freebsd.
The data files are now provided by the deskutils/calendar-data port. gitref:d20d6550187[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "daemon" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-H` flag, which causes it to catch SIGHUP and re-open the syslog file received, so log rotation from {{< manpage "newsyslog" "8">}} works properly. gitref:4cd407ec933[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "daemon" "8" >}} utility no longer blocks SIGTERM during the restart delay. gitref:09a3675d961[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "diskinfo" "8" >}} utility now reports the physical device name GEOM attribute when available. gitref:b5961be1ab7[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8" >}} utility now displays progress for the "Fetching files..." stage. gitref:d6e1e31a0e6[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-p` flag, which ensures password db changes are included in [.filename]#/etc/passwd# via {{< manpage "pwd_mkdb" "8">}}. gitref:9b6591109e8[repository=src] {{< sponsored "The FreeBSD Foundation" >}}

The {{< manpage "freebsd-update" "8" >}} utility now supports the `updatesready` and `showconfig` arguments to check for updates and check the configuration respectively. gitref:8cfda118cbd[repository=src]

The {{< manpage "inetd" "8" >}} utility now includes comments for all examples. gitref:26a4a61a285[repository=src]

[[userland-contrib]]
=== Contributed Software

The {{< manpage "bc" "1" >}} and {{< manpage "dc" "1" >}} utilities have been replaced by the version developed by Gavin D. Howard.
The new versions do not depend on an external large number library, offer GNU bc extensions, are much faster than and fix POSIX compliance issues of the programs they replace.
They support POSIX message catalogs and come with localized messages in Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Portugueze, and Russian.
The previous implementation is still available in FreeBSD-13 and can be selected instead of the new one by the build option `WITHOUT_GH_BC`. gitref:c41fef90a7d[repository=src]

[[userland-deprecated-programs]]
=== Deprecated Applications


[[userland-libraries]]
=== Runtime Libraries and API

The {{< manpage "getlocalbase" "3" >}} function has been added to libutil to retrieve the LOCALBASE path in a standard way. gitref:30d21d27953[repository=src]

[[kernel]]
== Kernel

This section covers changes to kernel configurations, system tuning, and system control parameters that are not otherwise categorized.

[[kernel-general]]
=== General Kernel Changes

Processes that attach to a {{< manpage "jail" "8" >}} will now completely rebase their {{< manpage "cpuset" "1" >}} onto the jail's cpuset.
Notably, if a process had been assigned a numbered cpuset then it will be assigned a new numbered set that is the combination of CPUs
allowed to the attaching process and the jail.
Processes belonging to the superuser will implicitly widen their CPU mask as needed if they share no CPUs in common with the jail.

[[drivers]]
== Devices and Drivers

This section covers changes and additions to devices and device drivers since {releasePrev}.

[[drivers-device]]
=== Device Drivers

A new man:usbhid[4] driver has been added, and can be loaded by adding `hw.usb.usbhid.enable=1` to [.filename]#/boot/loader.conf# and adding `usbhid` to `kld_list=""` in [.filename]#/etc/rc.conf#. gitref:b62f6dfaed3d[repository=src]

[[storage]]
== Storage

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other storage subsystems, both local and networked.

For {{< manpage "iscsi" "4" >}} and {{< manpage "ctld" "8" >}}, support for specifying network QoS in the form of DiffServ Codepoints (DSCP) and Ethernet Priority Code Point (PCP) was added. gitref:ddf1072aac49[repository=src] {{< sponsored "NetApp" >}}

The {{< manpage "ctld" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-f` flag, which tests the configuration file validity. gitref:7fcbecd004f[repository=src]

[[storage-general]]
=== General Storage


[[boot]]
== Boot Loader Changes

This section covers the boot loader, boot menu, and other boot-related changes.

The {{< manpage "efibootmgr" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-b` flag, which lets users specify by bootnum as an index. gitref:a2581e80212[repository=src] {{< sponsored "Netflix" >}}

The {{< manpage "efibootmgr" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-E` flag, which lets users query which EFI System Partition was used to boot the system. gitref:1cdb8eb8fe1[repository=src] {{< sponsored "Netflix" >}}

The {{< manpage "efibootmgr" "8" >}} utility now supports the `-f` and `-F` flags, which lets users tell the system to boot to the UEFI user interface or not. gitref:83c4237258d[repository=src] {{< sponsored "Ampere Computing, Inc." >}}

Prior releases had a complete ms-dos formatted filesystem packaged into boot1.efifat.
Older versions of FreeBSD installed this filesystem image into a raw partition.
However, uses of the ESP have proliferated, making this inflexible approach no longer desirable.
Users have varied needs for the size of this partition, and multiple booting setups require more detailed access.
To update old ESP partitions, users should stop using the {{< manpage "gpart" "8" >}} utility.
Instead, ESP partitions should be mounted as MS-DOS filesystems as [.filename]#/boot/efi#, and [.filename]#/boot/loader.efi# should be copied to [.filename]#/boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi# if the default setup is use.
If the {{< manpage "efibootmgr" "8" >}} utility is used to customize the boot environment, this file should be copied to the location set with the `-l` flag.

[[boot-loader]]
=== Boot Loader Changes


[[network]]
== Networking

This section describes changes that affect networking in FreeBSD.

For {{< manpage "tcp" "4">}}, Proportional Rate Reduction, as described by RFC6937, to improve SACK loss recovery during burst loss and ACK thinning scenarios, was implemented and is enabled by default.
A new {{< manpage "sysctl" "8" >}} has been added, `net.inet.tcp.do_prr`, which when set to `0` will restore the prior behavior.
It is expected that PRR generally helps improve loss recovery performance and prevent numerous preventable RTO stalls.
This surpasses the prior behavior, but a strictly packet conserving variant can be enabled.
When misconfigured token bucket traffic policer can cause persistent loss even during loss recovery, activating the conservative PRR variant may prevent some retransmission timeouts (RTO) and associated session stalls for a few milliseconds while behaving less optimal in the general case.
For this, a new {{< manpage "sysctl" "8">}} was added, `net.inet.tcp.do_prr_conservative`.
Setting this variable to `1` will enable strictly packet conserving behavior (at most 1 segment for each ACK received), while the normal variant may send up to 2 segments per received ACK - helping in cases of ACK thinning or significant burst loss events.  gitref:0e1d7c25c5ab[repository=src] {{< sponsored "NetApp" >}}

The {{< manpage "cc_cubic" "4">}} has been improved to address various corner cases and align more closely with the standard in RFC8312. gitref:40f9078ff9d9[repository=src] {{< sponsored "NetApp" >}}

The {{< manpage "ping" "8" >}} and {{< manpage "ping6" "8" >}} utilities both support setting network QoS, with IP DSCP gitref:6034024daddb[repository=src] and Ethernet PCP gitref:81a6f4c7ae69[repository=src] {{< sponsored "NetApp" >}}

[[network-general]]

=== Packaging Changes


[[future-releases]]
== General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

[[future-releases-cputype]]
=== Default `CPUTYPE` Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default `CPUTYPE` for the i386 architecture will change from `486` to `686`.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release Engineering team.
The FreeBSD 13.0 code base will continue to support older CPUs.
Users needing this functionality, however, will need to build their own releases to obtain this support.

As the embedded market is the primary user of cores based on i486 and i586, end-user impact is expected to be minimal.
Most embedded systems have custom builds already.
Althought some minor adjust will be necessary, it will be on par with the effort required to move between major versions.
Server and desktop machines based on these CPU types are generally over 20 years old.
Most have been retired or are too resource poor to make FreeBSD 13.0 an attractive upgrade.

There were several factors taken into account for this change.
Most applications need 64-bit atomics for proper operation.
While those operations can be emulated in the kernel on i486, they cannot be emulated in the userland.
Updating the default allows compiler generated code to select the right atomics in those cases, allow better optimizations and produce better error messages when necessary.
The older library and/or include file approaches are much less optimal in resulting code and diagnostics.
Current compiler technology produces better, faster, and/or smaller binaries for i686 than for i486.
Several bugs in compiler support for i486 code generation attest to its lesser use in the wider ecosystem.
In the wider ecosystem, i686 has been the default for many years so has received more testing and more optimization.
Finally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their inception.
These factors strongly suggest that a i686 default will provide such an improved enough user experience to offset the minor pain for those few users of the older technology.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` option in the kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience.
This also aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default `CPUTYPE` in i386.
