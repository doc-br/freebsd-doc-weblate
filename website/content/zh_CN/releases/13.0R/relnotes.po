"The default `CPUTYPE` for the i386 architecture is now `686` (instead of "
"`486`)."

"This means that binaries require a 686-class CPU by default including, but "
"not limited to, binaries provided by the FreeBSD Release Engineering team.  "
"The FreeBSD 13.0 code base continues to support older CPUs.  Users who need "
"to run on 486- or 586-class CPUs need to build their own releases."

"As the embedded market is the primary user of cores based on i486 and i586, "
"end-user impact is expected to be minimal.  Most embedded systems have "
"custom builds already.  Although some minor adjustments will be necessary, "
"it will be on par with the effort required to move between major versions.  "
"Server and desktop machines based on these CPU types are generally over 20 "
"years old.  Most have been retired or are too resource poor to make FreeBSD "
"13.0 an attractive upgrade."

"There were several factors taken into account for this change.  Most "
"applications need 64-bit atomics for proper operation.  While those "
"operations can be emulated in the kernel on i486, they cannot be emulated in "
"userland.  Updating the default allows compiler generated code to select the "
"right atomics in those cases, allow better optimizations and produce better "
"error messages when necessary.  The older library and/or include file "
"approaches are much less optimal in resulting code and diagnostics.  Current "
"compiler technology produces better, faster, and/or smaller binaries for "
"i686 than for i486.  Several bugs in compiler support for i486 code "
"generation attest to its lesser use in the wider ecosystem.  In the wider "
"ecosystem, i686 has been the default for many years so has received more "
"testing and more optimization.  Finally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have "
"been i686 since their inception.  These factors strongly suggest that a i686 "
"default will provide such an improved enough user experience to offset the "
"minor pain for those few users of the older technology."

"As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32 "
"libraries on 64-bit hardware with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` option in the "
"kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience.  This also "
"aligns with what the majority of Linux(R) distributions have been doing for "
"quite some time."
