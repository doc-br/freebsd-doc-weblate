"For {{< manpage \"tcp\" \"4\">}}, Proportional Rate Reduction, as described "

"There were several factors taken into account for this change.  Most "
"applications need 64-bit atomics for proper operation.  While those "
"operations can be emulated in the kernel on i486, they cannot be emulated in "
"the userland.  Updating the default allows compiler generated code to select "
"the right atomics in those cases, allow better optimizations and produce "
"better error messages when necessary.  The older library and/or include file "
"approaches are much less optimal in resulting code and diagnostics.  Current "
"compiler technology produces better, faster, and/or smaller binaries for "
"i686 than for i486.  Several bugs in compiler support for i486 code "
"generation attest to its lesser use in the wider ecosystem.  In the wider "
"ecosystem, i686 has been the default for many years so has received more "
"testing and more optimization.  Finally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have "
"been i686 since their inception.  These factors strongly suggest that a i686 "
"default will provide such an improved enough user experience to offset the "
"minor pain for those few users of the older technology."
